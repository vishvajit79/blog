Went to Whitewater Rafting down the Ottawa River through @Rafting Momentum. Such an amazing experience.

I booked the heart-pounding rafting experience through@Rafting Momentum  website with a night's stay and added an extra night so I can reach there a day before. It cost me around 160 bucks for the whole thing including 2 night's stay, rafting, lunch, and dinner (Beer of course). On the way, we did some river surfing, and cliff jumping. Super fun day! Special thanks to my raft's guide Mark and my teammates (Thunderblast) for making the experience memorable and fun.
