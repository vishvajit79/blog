Fox West Island in Killarney Provincial Park is an amazing spot. It's a crown land so you don't have to reserve a particular campsite, it's first come first serve. We rented canoes from Killarney Outfitters and they were kind to deliver them to Chikanishing Creek Boat Launch.

We did a 4-day canoe camping in the Georgian Bay and went up to Fox West Island. All the sites were very clean but finding a good spot is difficult as there is no flat land.
